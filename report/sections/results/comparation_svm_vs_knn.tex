\subsection{Comparation between KNN and SVM algorithms}
Finally, to better understand the performance of the two algorithms studied (KNN and SVM), they were compared for each of the two datasets. Specifically, the hyperparameters that yielded the best model, according with what was discussed in the previous subsections, were selected.
