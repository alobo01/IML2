\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
Present the findings and the conclusions of the statistical analysis. For each technique, we will separately discuss the results obtained with each of the 2 datasets. It is important to note that in the study of each dataset we have considered each of the 10 folds as separate datasets in order to perform the statistical analysis. This consideration is sub-optimal, but necessary due to the time and hardware constraints.
